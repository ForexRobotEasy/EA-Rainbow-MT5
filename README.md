## Description

The EA Rainbow MT5 is a trading robot that uses the Rainbow indicator to generate buy and sell signals. It is designed to trade on the MetaTrader 5 platform.

The input parameters for the EA include:

- RainbowPeriod: Period for the Rainbow indicator.
- LotSize: Base lot size for trading.
- DynamicLot: Enable dynamic lot size calculation based on account balance and stop loss.
- LotIncreaseCoefficient: Coefficient for increasing lot size.
- GridDistance: Grid distance for order placement.
- MaxLotSize: Maximum allowed lot size.
- TakeProfit: Take profit level in points.
- StopLoss: Stop loss level in points.
- StopLossPercentage: Stop loss percentage of the deposit.

The EA places buy and sell orders based on the signals generated by the Rainbow indicator. It checks if there are open orders and if the maximum number of orders has not been reached. If a buy signal is generated, a buy order is placed at the current market price. If a sell signal is generated, a sell order is placed at the current market price.

The lot size for each order can be calculated dynamically based on the account balance and stop loss level. If the DynamicLot parameter is enabled, the lot size is calculated as the account balance multiplied by the stop loss percentage divided by the stop loss level. The lot size is then normalized and capped at the maximum allowed lot size.

## Usage

To use the EA Rainbow MT5, follow these steps:

1. Install the EA on the MetaTrader 5 platform.
